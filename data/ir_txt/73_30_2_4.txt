THE PSALMS AS HISTORIOGRAPHY HAROLD M. PARKER, JR. Through the years the Psalms have inspired numerous studies embracing religion, theology, literary characteristics and the relation of Psalmody to the cult. However one area of Psalter studies has been neglected-the presentation of history in the Psalms. Again, numerous studies have been made of the various historiographies in the Old Testament, embracing the Yahwist, the Elohist, the Priestly Code, the Deuteronomist, the Chronicler, the Apocalyptist, the Prophetic School, but the historiography of the Psalms has been neglected. On occasion commentators have appeared to be on the brink of an essay into the subject, but the matter is strangely dropped, and not even the outline of an excursus emerges.1 A factor which has perhaps unintentionally militated against such a study in the Psalter derives from the major thrust in Psalm-studies in this century. Charles August Briggs' monumental study2 placed great emphasis upon the literary phenomena of the Psalms to the neglect of other factors. Hermann Gunkel, the father of modern Psalm-studies, emphasized Gattungen and tended to underscore the literary groupings of the Psalms.3 The next student to approach the Psalms was Sigmund Mowinckel.4 He examined the cultic origins of the Psalms and related them to Temple practice. Function rather than content was emphasized. An attempt to check this trend came from the facile pens of Norman H. Snaith and W. i. E. Oesterley. These long-time students of the Psalms incisively pointed out that in the attempt to compare Hebrew political and liturgical practices with those of other cultures of the Ancient Near East too much emphasis had been placed on supposed similarities rather than on differences, and the former are frequently found lacking in the biblical account.5 For in-HAROLD M.

However, most students of the Psalms continue to be persuaded by the contributions which flow from the studies of Gunkel and Mowinckel.6 Since 1930, with the discovery of the Canaanite library at Ugarit, increasing emphasis has been placed on the relationship between Israelite psalmody and that of the Canaanites. This trend has been supported by the contributions of such scholars as John Hastings Patton7 and, in more recent years by Mitchell Dahood.8 In the meantime, the discovery and publication of psalms at Qumran-particularly the materials at Cave 11-focus on the phenomenon that psalms were still being written up to the beginning of the Christian era. Thus, as this superficial resume reveals, the study of the Psalms has shifted from emphasis to emphasis in this century in such a dramatic fashion that one may hazard the assertion that no part of the Old Testament has undergone such a bombardment of scholarly analysis and reinterpreta-tion as has the Psalter. The results are such that they overpower the cautious student and challenge the more adventuresome. Israel's existence and history did not take place within a political vacuum. She seldom attained the heights of a great power; most of her existence was passed within the shadows of the great empires that surrounded her. Her location as a "bridge" between the transient empires of the Tigris-Euphrates valley to the east and the more stable Egypt to the southwest could only place her in a position where she would be the recipient of cultural diffusion. Even the little states-Phoenicia, Philistia, Ammon, Moab, Edom, Arabia, Syria-affected her, as did the residue of the Canaanites. The amazing thing is that she had anything that was peculiar to her. Even Psalmody was not a literary genre peculiar to the Hebrews.9 Examples abound throughout the Ancient Near East of hymns of praise to national gods. There is considerable evidence, for example, that a Hymn to Aton was borrowed by the Hebrews and reworked to become Psalm 104.10 Again, however, it is not so much t^ie similarities as it is the differences that distinguished Hebrew psalmody from that of eFor a splendid essay on these interpretations, see A .R.

For while the psalms of Babylon, Egypt, Akkad or Phoenicia freqently deal with creation or myths, Hebrew psalms add a new dimension: they treat their God as active in history, as the Lord of history. Other gods are not so depicted. In the psalmody of the Ancient Near East, as Elmer A. Leslie has so interestingly pointed out, "we meet, as in the Psalms, the language of the individual and social worship, the mood of devotion to deity, the desire for fellowship and right relations with the deity, the ceremonies and rituals of the public cult, and lyrical and religious utterance from the heart of pious individuals/'11 but we are not introduced to a god working in history. However, the Hebrew hymns, as Wm. R. Taylor has so keenly commented, "different from those of other ancient peoples, appeal to history as an evidence of the greatness of their God."12 If a Hymn writer wished to celebrate the glorious doings of God how could he do so better than by recalling the mighty acts by which Israel had been freed from Egypt and brought at last into the land of promise. The composer of a Lament, whose aim was to induce God to intervene on behalf of His people, could find in these same mighty acts a compelling reason why God should save Israel in the present. A Wisdom Psalmist, undertaking to exhort and warn his contemporaries, might well draw from ancient stories the admonition that Israel today should not repeat the rebellion of the fathers who were overthrown in the wilderness.13 It was not just that God acted in history; it was rather that from these acts Israel is distinctive-she has a faith, laws, a land, a royal line. She is the people of Yahweh. The call of the Patriarchs, the migration to Canaan, the sojourn in Egypt, the Exodus experience, the Wilderness wanderings, the Settlement, the emergence of the Throne-in all these God's hand is evident, and God has "come in history into relation with His own people."14 No Assyrian ever felt that way about his god; but as Johannes Hempel has observed, "History as the realm of Yah-weh's power is a theme which is specifically Israelite. Yahweh is primarily the god of history, of the other nations connected with Israel 1:LElmer Archibald Leslie, "Psalms, Book of," Twentieth Century Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge 2:923.

Welch, The Psalter: In Life, Worship and History (Oxford: Clarendon, 1926) 49. 35  (e.g., Amos 9:7) and of the world/'15 And so closely related to God is Israel through his acts and through the formalizing of history through the covenant experience that in times of adversity God is reminded of his mighty works on behalf of his people in the past and is thus urgently entreated to come to their aid again (Ps. 44). The nature of the history portrayed in the Psalms-as well as that throughout the Old Testament-is not history as we normally think of it, i.e., the written record of man's past; it is Heusgeschichte-holy history, salvation history, the story of redemption. Arthur Weicer has correctly observed that "the difference between the psalms and their hymnic parallels in the religions of the neighbouring countries becomes even more striking when we consider the Heilsgeschichte which forms the subject matter of the psalms."16 When one reads the so-called "historical psalms"17 he becomes aware of a grand recital of past events whereby Israel's covenant God, Yahweh, and Israel have become comrades in their living together.18 However it is not the close relationship of Yahweh to His people that alone makes the Psalter's historiography unique; it is the manner in which the mighty acts of God are viewed from the perspective of the existential present. The sins of Israel are reviewed, confessed,moaned (see esp. Ps. 106:6-7, 13-14, 19-22, 24-25, 28-29, 32-39, 43, 47).19 Here is an interpretation which far transcends even the historiography of the Ancient Near East wherein kings and Pharaohs boasted in their virtues and military prowess. Israel's understanding of history stands unique among the national traditions of mankind. Fleming James has raised some honest questions at this point: 'What other people have seen their whole past as a chain of sins? Among the nations of the present does any stand as penitent before God? Nay, do the religious people in any nation regard its past and its present with repentance?"20 Thus was the prophetic voice heard in the Psalms. The events of the past in ancient days were handed down orally and epigraphically. We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us, what deeds thou didst perform in their days, in the days of old, (Ps. 44:1) 15Johannes Hempel, "Psalms, Book of," IntDB L-Q: 948. 16Weiser, Psalms 59. 17Normally these as Pss. 78, 105, 106, 135 and 136. In this study other Psalms have been examined: 44, 46, 68, 74, 79t 80, 81, 83, 87, 89, 111, 114, 137 and 149. 18Leslie, Psalms 160; Gunkel, Einleitung in den Psalmen (Gottingen, 1933) 78. 19The English order of the Psalms and versification are followed in this article, and all quotations are from the RSV unless otherwise noted. 20James, Thirty Psalmists 234. 36  and I will open my mouth in a parable; I will utter dark sayings from of old, things that we have heard and known, that our fathers have told us, ( Ps. 78:2,3 ) are passages indicative that history was passed down by word of mouth from generation to generation. Such a method of transmission by no means invalidates the content, for as the late Wm. F. Albright called to our attention, "Writing was used in antiquity largely as an aid or guide to memory, not as a substitute for it."21 Even before the traditions of the Pentateuch became literature, there was oral transmission. It is not an easy matter to ascertain precisely which literary sources the psalmists used. If each Psalm could be dated specifically, even this would not necessarily be an accurate aid. Furthermore, the psalmists did not write objective history, and there is much evidence to suggest that they adapted some traditions to their immediate purpose.22 But much of the theology behind the sources was utilized, as a closer examination of the Deuteronomist on the psalter will reveal. The sin-begets-punishment, righteousness-begets prosperity ethic of the Deuteronomist is discernable in Ps. 44: Thou hast made us the taunt of our neighbors; the derision and scorn of those about us. Thou hast made us a byword among the nations, a laughingstock among the peoples. # * * * All this has come upon us, though we have not forgotten thee, or been false to thy covenant. (Ps. 44:13-15, 17) The protests of the psalmist can be understood only against the Deuteronmist background, for he believed that God blesses in proportion to obedience and punishes in proportion to disobedience.28 If Ps. 44:13-17 is the negative approach to Deuteronmist theology, certainly Ps. 94:14-15 is the positive affirmation: For the Lord will not forsake his people; he will not abondon his heritage; for justice will return to the righteous, and all the upright in heart will follow it. 21William Foxwell Albright, Prom the Stone Age to Christianity: Monotheism and theical Process (2nd ed.; Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday, 1957) 64. 22This is particularly true of Ps. 78. Many of these details differ from the Exodus account; cf. McCullough, IntB 4:415. 23Rhodes, Psalms 77-7%. 37  Ps. 106:40-43 is permeated with Deuteronomistic religious historiography. Here Israel's history is understood by Leslie as "being in-dissolubly linked with issues of morality and religion."24 Literary dependence on the Pentateuchal sources is evident throughout the historical Psalms. A few examples will suffice. Ps. 106:19 refers to Horeb. Throughout Deuteronomy, except 32:2, this is always the name given to Sinai, and its use in Ps. 106 appears to point to the narrative in Deut. 9:8-12. Ps. 135:14 is a direct quotation from Deut. 32:36. In Ps. 44:20 is found an explicit reference to the Ñ document of Gen. 6:12-13. When God saw the awful corruption to which creation had slipped he went into action, destroying the corrupt generation utterly, but saving the righteous Noah and his sons. Now the psalmist urges God to look again and become just as concerned over the present corruption that is oppressing his creatures.25 Weiser pointed out that the variations from the Pentateuchal traditions in Ps. 106 with Exodus (Ps. 106:7-Ex. 14:10-12 (J and E); Ps. 106:9-Ex. 14:15-18 (E and P); Ps. 106:12-Ex. 14:31 (E) ) "show that there can be no question of a direct literary dependence by the psalm on the Pentateuch. . . />26 Such a literary dependence would also assist in establishing the date of the psalm as late Exilic or post-Exilic. Precise dating of the individual psalm could contribute toward an understanding of its historiographical contributions, but such precise-ness does not seem possible at the present.27 In some instances the psalmist has simply drawn upon the vast literature and lore of his people to write history (e.g., Pss. 78, 105, 106, 135, 136); in other instances he is almost a "primary source" inasmuch as he stands at the brink-if not the center-of the activity which he is describing (e.g., Pss. 44, 46, 74,137). Because the Psalms are poetry, they tend to carry archaic terms with them. There is also the tendency to idealize, to generalize, to exaggerate. Hence the dating of a psalm is at best a risky business. Internal evidence is all that can be employed for each particular psalm, "from what may be more or less clearly read out of it, due regard being given to what is otherwise known to us about the spiritual and religious history and state of Israel at different times," as Mowinckel has cautioned.28 Thus Elmer Leslie has set forth the axiom that it is not 24Leslie, Psalms 169. Certainly Ps. 78 breathes Deuteronomisms. 25Ibid. 237. 26Weiser, Psalms 681. 27For the proposed dates of the Psalms used as the basis for this study, see the Appendix. 28Mowinckel, Psalms in Israel's Worship 2:153. 38  the date of the psalm which is important, but its function: what was it intended to do?29 There are trends even in the dating of psalms. Charles Augustus Briggs, for instance, writing near the beginning of the present century, tended to date psalms late; Ivan Engnell, writing in 1941, found only one psalm (Ps. 137) that he could classify as post-Exilic,30 and Robert H. Pfeiffer, in his monumental Introduction, found only two-Pss. 24:7-10 and 45.31 Artur Weiser represents a current trend to date the psalms early on the grounds that if they had been composed in the post-Exilic era there would have been more allusions to the post-Exilic ritual laws; but such allusions are not to be found.82 And because of Israel's varied history, it is not even possible that all the national disasters alluded to in the Psalms refer to the collapse of Judah.33 We conclude this study, which is at best only an introduction to the larger area of the historiography of the Psalter, by making an affirmation and at the same time posing a problem. The affirmation is that the Psalms do indeed discuss history and they are singular among the literature of the Ancient Near East in so doing. Thus the general topic of the historiography of the Psalter is one that invites perusal. The problem consists in dating the individual psalm. History generally treats with the past, occasionally, with the present, never with the future. So long as it is difficult to date the individual psalm with pre-ciseness, we shall never really know whether there are psalms that are actually speaking to the existential moment. Through their literary dependence on earlier sources and by means of utilizing the broad events of Israel's past, we can readily ascertain how they reworked and used epigraphical and traditional materials. But we can never be really certain whether they relate a contemporary event. 29Leslie, "Psalms," 2:924; Elmer A.
