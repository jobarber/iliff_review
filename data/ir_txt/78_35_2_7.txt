THEOLOGICAL POEM (With some credit for deriving ideas from Wilson Yates and Mary Daly) The Goodness of God will not be penetrated by the mere maleness of man. We must dance and hope for the Creation to Become as woman and man together. You can't force it, But, together, in reality, at noon today we might push and shove and Make It Come. And then fall panting into each other's arms and sweaty and holy and whole. Then we would Be And God. God Is strange that way. All those years they thought He had a penis Even after we came out of His vagina. But in the bright light, under the hot sun, at noon today, with no clothes on, We will change that conception. It is only a dance But then if you don't dance, there is nothing to do. 77  God is volatile and obscure and creative- We don't half know what God Is. -GAYLE GRAHAM YATES JOSEPH Blessed are you among the sons of men for accepting as your own one who was not your own, for showing and telling without keeping books. Did you bite your lip? Did you grin to bear it? Did you wear a sheepish smile when you gave that fatherless child your full inheritance: a keen eye, a steady hand, a singularity of bearing. You, Joseph, are a man without claims. As you were before Christ so you shall be after him. -LEROY MOORE, JR. Gayle Graham Yates, author of What Women Want (Harvard University Press), is Director of Women's Studies at the University of Minnesota. LeRoy Moore, Jr., formerly on the faculty of Golden Gate and Hartford Theological Seminaries, has taught at the University of Denver parttime since 1974. 78
