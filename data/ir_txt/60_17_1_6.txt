cA jModern Canticle o^Praiae CHARLES S. MILLIGAN O Thou who art from everlasting to everlasting; Life of all that lives, blending of all beauty, Destiny of all striving, power of all truth: Who giveth The warm sun that there may be light, The fertile soil that there may be life, Onflowing hours that there may ever be creation; Who blesseth all creatures With changing season that there may be loveliness, With discord that there may be harmony, With death that all things may be made new; Who bringeth forth Perpetual yearning that there may be growth, The babbling tongue that there may be friendship, The subtle hand that there may be invention; Who raiseth up within the human breast Silent awe that there may be worship, Joys inexpressible that there may be music, Selfless desires that there may be love; Who settleth upon the earth Invisible customs that there may be pathways, Unceasing variation that there may be personality, Unending change that there may be adventure; Who sustaineth throughout the vast universe Unwritten laws that there may be wisdom, Fragile seedlings that there may be faith, Eternal stars that there may be humility: Oh, to these things let us not be as those who have eyes but see not, and hear not though they have ears. Neither let us misuse life and its ways. Nor let us fear them. Redeem our peevish longing for signs and wonders into an awesome beholding of the heavens, which declare thy glory, and the firmament, which showeth forth thy handiwork. Thou art source of all and doth indwell in all. Into One Wondrous Life thou dost unite these holy things. Let everything that hath breath praise thee. And also the dust and the mists. And dreams and silences. For thou art dwelling place of all. For thou art God. 47
