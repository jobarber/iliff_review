28 THE ILIFF REVIEW Poem For The Liberation of St. Patrick's Day An acre chosen, wanton laid by depth of bridges early made at youth's evening. At the dawn man comes to know his acred past yields but a show of emptiness. And so we walk into another hour. A hunted place, ravished by time but succored by the pleading rhyme of wanting hands. And at the corner of the lake a turquoise maid sells papercake with her eyes. (Another day goes by). Holly scribbles on the windowpane, an obelisk for all the years I've lain in doubt. A stolen hour, for self to bless, a self to love to pay the quest for being. We can only be what we are. An evening acre, an empty stage left to them all our silent rage of struggle. (Of the ashes of passion man comes to be). An acre chosen, a hearthstone laid, a soft road taken, decision played for an army. An acre vacant, his army sings; he breathed and in that breath did bring a freedom. He smiled when he come home.
