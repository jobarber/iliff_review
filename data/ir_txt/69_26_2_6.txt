Uwo Poema SIDNEY SNOW An Obelisk For La Trappe I rode the wings of an evil bird who cawed on his way to the palace. An odor of dampness immersed my freedom and told me that the palace was the reward. Another bird flew by, selling papercake with knowing eyes; A white bird, and caring, which ripped my mask from unready face. The searcher stood, naked before the dawn, confessor and penitent made the same by personhood. A feather from the raven fell, a vanguard from the palace, gilded like plainchant upon the eyes. Crumbs from the papercake lay between the grass. Fulfilled, I stood, and the white bird returned to my shoulder. The palace chorus chanted psalms and penalties in its best plainsong. I dropped the raven's pen then, and added my laughter to the chorus, a harmony to complete the counterpoint. We will not carve our names on ivy, nor scratch them upon rocks. I have touched a bird who will always be free, who yet trembles beneath my hands. I have fought a foe who was not the enemy; I have shared and I have doubted, And I have tasted banishment for looking at the sky.
