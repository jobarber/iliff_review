WALTER G. WILLIAMS - IN MEMORIAM 1903-1983 Walter G. Williams, Professor Emeritus of Old Testament Literature and Religion, died on October 27, 1983, after a prolonged illness. At that time the winter issue of The Iliff Review had already gone to press, and although this announcement comes some months later, it is with undiminished appreciation, affection and honor on the part of family, colleagues and students that this memorial word is published. For his contribution to the life of the school and service to the church were outstanding and enduring. Dr. Williams taught on the Iliff faculty from 1942 to 1973 and also served for a time as Dean of Students and Interim President. As visiting professor he taught in Europe, Cuba, Jerusalem and Taiwan. Among his many publications are: The Prophets: Pioneers in Christianity (chapters of which first appeared in this journal), Archeology and Biblical Research, and The Making of Biblical Literature (which is still in print). Some of his writings have been translated into Spanish, French, and Chinese. In 1967 The Iliff Review published a festschrift issue in his honor, with a more detailed account of his accomplishments and contributions, with complete bibliography to that date. This issue is still available in limited quantity. After Dr. Williams' retirement students, family and friends established a lectureship in his honor, inaugurated in 1982, and the family requested that memorial gifts be sent to the Walter G. Williams Lectureship in Old Testament in care of The Iliff School of Theology. His widow, Mary, who herself has occupied a very significant role in the life of the school, resides at Frasier Meadows Manor, 350 Ponca Place, Boulder, CO 80303. 3
